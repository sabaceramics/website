      <h1>Handcrafted ceramics,<br>inspired by nature</h1>
      <div class="hero-description">
        <p>Welcome to the official website of Saba Ceramics. We are Silvia and Giulio. In our work, we explore the spontaneous effects created by fire and natural materials. We aim to create graceful, warm, and timeless designs for interior décor and everyday objects. At times, our practice blends pottery, painting, and sculpture.</p>
        <p>We take a hands-on approach, avoiding techniques that distance us from the creative process. We often fire our pieces in a raku kiln or use wood firing with the saggar technique. Along this journey, we embrace ancient firing methods, making each piece truly one of a kind, with its own story to tell.</p>
        <p>Nature is our main source of inspiration. Through our handcrafted pieces, we strive to reconnect people with the natural world. Each object is carefully crafted from the very beginning—from the design stage, to wheel-throwing or hand-building, to firing and, when needed, protective treatments to ensure long-lasting durability.</p>

       <div class="about-description">
        <p class="about-highlight">The name 'Saba' comes from an ancient syrup made from boiled grape must during the harvest.</p>
        <p>Traditionally used for 'sabadoni', a dessert from our roots, it represents the heritage we cherish. We chose it to reflect the same rustic beauty and natural effects we seek in our work.</p>

          <h3>Giulio</h3>
          <p><i>"For me, ceramics is an endless field of experimentation and surprise, especially through alternative and ancient firing methods. I see firing as a natural process, where glazes melt like rock turning into magma. Inspired by history and Oriental aesthetics, my work seeks to reinterpret the elegance of classical forms and the harmony of Eastern shapes, bringing all my passions together in a single craft."</i></p>

          <h3>Silvia</h3>
          <p><i>I am a sculptor and visual artist. I have explored the world of polymer clays, oil paints, and watercolors, and with Saba I began working with natural clay. In my work, I depict the forms of nature, particularly trees and animals, with which I feel an emotional and symbolic connection, and I seek to reinterpret them with a fantasy and fairytale-like vision."</i></p>
