      <h1>Handcrafted ceramics,<br>inspired by nature</h1>
      <div class="hero-description">
        <p>Welcome to the official website of Saba Ceramics. We are Silvia and Giulio. In our work, we explore the spontaneous effects created by fire and natural materials. We aim to create graceful, warm, and timeless designs for interior décor and everyday objects. At times, our practice blends pottery, painting, and sculpture.</p>
        <p>We take a hands-on approach, avoiding techniques that distance us from the creative process. We often fire our pieces in a raku kiln or use wood firing with the saggar technique. Along this journey, we embrace ancient firing methods, making each piece truly one of a kind, with its own story to tell.</p>
        <p>Nature is our main source of inspiration. Through our handcrafted pieces, we strive to reconnect people with the natural world. Each object is carefully crafted from the very beginning—from the design stage, to wheel-throwing or hand-building, to firing and, when needed, protective treatments to ensure long-lasting durability.</p>
        <p>By choosing a Saba Ceramics piece for yourself or as a gift for your loved ones, you choose the quality of a unique object, born from our hands and minds from start to finish.</p>

       <div class="about-description">
        <p>Saba Ceramics is Giulio and Silvia: the vessel where our creative drives converge.</p>
        <p>The name 'Saba' comes from an ancient syrup made from boiled grape must during the harvest. Traditionally used for 'sabadoni', a dessert from our roots, it represents the heritage we cherish. We chose it to reflect the same rustic beauty and natural effects we seek in our work.</p>

          <h3>Giulio Galamini</h3>
          <p><i>"Ceramics is my passion—an infinite world of experimentation and surprise, especially when working with alternative or ancient firing methods. As a geologist, I see ceramic firings as small representations of natural processes: a melting glaze is nothing more than rock turning into magma.

Techniques such as raku and saggar allow me to explore these unpredictable transformations. Passionate about history and Oriental aesthetics, my work on the potter’s wheel seeks to reinterpret the elegance of classical forms and the harmony of Eastern shapes. Ceramics brings together all my passions in a single craft."</i></p>
