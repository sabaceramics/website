The piece was wheel-thrown and fired using the American raku technique, with a handmade glaze in aqua blue tones, enhanced by yellow brushstrokes.

In American raku, the ceramic piece is removed from the kiln while still glowing hot and placed into closed containers with combustible materials. This process gives the glazes unique and unrepeatable colors and surface effects.
The unglazed areas, still porous at high temperatures, absorb the smoke during the reduction process, which becomes permanently fixed in the clay body.

White Raku Ceramic Candle Holder Tray, Craquelé Effect, Black Moon, Warm Home Atmosphere;"Raku Stoneware Candle Holder – Starry Sky and Moon
This candle holder represents a starry sky: the candlelight shines through the stars, creating a warm and cozy glow in your room. At the top, a small crescent moon is depicted.

The dome-shaped candle holder is integrated with a tray, made as a single piece: the dome and tray are not separate elements. The piece was wheel-thrown, while the holes and the moon were entirely handcrafted.

The white glaze is handmade, producing a striking black craquelé effect typical of raku. Being American raku, the piece was removed from the kiln while still glowing hot and placed in a closed container with combustible materials. This allows smoke to penetrate the unglazed areas, giving the moon and the glaze cracks their unique black color.

As visible in the photos, the tray features a small white trapezoid. This is a fragment of a pyrometric cone, an object used to measure heat work in ceramic kilns, which fused with the piece during firing. Rather than a flaw, it is a trace of how unexpected elements can become distinctive features in handmade ceramics, especially in the raku technique, enhancing the material and artisanal character.

Wheel-thrown, the vase was treated with a white sealed clay and polished to enhance the natural luster of the terracotta. Each pattern and shade is unique, resulting from a spontaneous saggar firing: the vase was placed inside a small closed container along with plant materials and natural salts, and fired in a gas kiln.

The palette of reds, oranges, ochres, and blacks comes from the organic materials used: iron wires left dark, irregular marks, banana peels created pastel gray streaks, and soda salts produced delicate light oranges.

Stoneware vase, brown terra sigillata on the exterior, amber raku glaze on the interior, textured surface.;"This vase is made of stoneware and was thrown on the potter's wheel. A thin layer of brown terra sigillata, rich in iron oxides, has been applied to the exterior surface, following a technique used in antiquity. The interior has been glazed with an amber-colored glaze and fired with the raku technique. The thermal shock the terrasigillata undergoes during raku firing provided the exterior surface an antique, textured appearance. Finally, the vase has been protected with mineral wax.
The vase is designed for interior decoration and can be paired with dried plants.

Pit-fired saggar vase, organic decorations;"Unique Saggar-Pit-Fired Vessel.
This wheel-thrown, rounded vessel is a celebration of spontaneous, natural processes in ceramic art. Initially stone-burnished, its surface has a subtle sheen.

The remarkable, unrepeatable patterns and colors are the result of a saggar firing within a bonfire pit. The vibrant palette of reds, ochres, and blacks is created by materials packed around the pot:

Copper wire left dark brown or black streaks, sometimes with greenish spots in the center, as in this pot.

Diverse plant leaves on the unglazed clay created haunting smoky gray and black carbon deposits and unique textures.

Salt was used to create unique effects on one side of the vessel, leaving behind striking gray spots and soft, pastel pink halos.

To finish, the vessel was polished with a natural protective wax, enhancing the depth of the colors and protecting the raw surface. This piece is where the flames themselves become the artists, transforming clay into a unique, painterly object.";109;EUR;1;Ceramic_Art,Saggar_Fired,Pit_Fired,Wheel_Thrown_Pottery,Stone_Burnished,Raku,Smoke_Fired,Natural_Wax_Finish,Unique_Vessel,Artisanal_Pottery,Organic_ceramics,Primitive_firing,Red_vase;Ceramica;https://i.etsystatic.com/57670088/r/il/37940a/7572093429/il_fullxfull.7572093429_pd41.jpg;https://i.etsystatic.com/57670088/r/il/d8c5bd/7292378949/il_fullxfull.7292378949_f5p7.jpg;https://i.etsystatic.com/57670088/r/il/abe7ef/7292379159/il_fullxfull.7292379159_tw9f.jpg;https://i.etsystatic.com/57670088/r/il/156220/7244419358/il_fullxfull.7244419358_r1mu.jpg;https://i.etsystatic.com/57670088/r/il/a82fb2/7244419368/il_fullxfull.7244419368_r2sw.jpg;https://i.etsystatic.com/57670088/r/il/f13841/7244419476/il_fullxfull.7244419476_ojb1.jpg;https://i.etsystatic.com/57670088/r/il/a4d1d4/7244420432/il_fullxfull.7244420432_qu1u.jpg;https://i.etsystatic.com/57670088/r/il/9df64d/7244420520/il_fullxfull.7244420520_ge60.jpg;https://i.etsystatic.com/57670088/r/il/2b0a12/7292380185/il_fullxfull.7292380185_cey4.jpg;;;;;;;;
Pit-fired vase, sculpted fox head, black moon lid;"Vase with Fox Figure and Crescent Moon Lid, Wood-Fired in a Pit

In the saggar technique, the flame leaves permanent marks on the ceramic surface, created by the materials placed in direct contact with it. For this piece, a combination of iron wash, copper wire, sawdust, leaves, salts, and other plant-based materials was used. These natural traces are further enhanced by the polishing of the clay, done before firing through a traditional burnishing process—repeatedly rubbing the surface with a smooth stone.
The vase features a sculpted fox head, a symbol of nature and grace.

The lid represents a crescent moon, a symbol of renewal and energy. The black color comes from wood smoke and black acrylic paint.
Entirely handcrafted and wheel-thrown, this piece is also carefully sculpted. It is made of unglazed ceramic, just like pottery was for thousands of years before the invention of glaze, and has been pit-fired with wood, resulting in unique and unrepeatable chromatic and tactile effects.

The exterior has been polished with eco-friendly protective wax.

Saggar vase, antique pink, black moon lid, spontaneous surface effects;"Lidded vase fired in saggar using organic materials such as sugar, plant leaves, sawdust, salts, and copper wire. During the wood firing, the flame creates permanent and unpredictable marks on the ceramic surface. The clay was polished before firing by repeatedly rubbing it with a smooth natural stone. The pale pink color results from iron.

This piece is entirely handcrafted. The lid is decorated with a crescent moon, blackened by wood smoke and finished with black acrylic paint.

Traces of the materials used during firing remain visible on the surface, enhancing the vase’s uniqueness. This unglazed ceramic was wood-fired in a pit, producing one-of-a-kind effects that cannot be replicated.

Vase, saggar-fired ceramic, leaves and copper wire marks;"Interior vase for dried flowers, wood-fired using the saggar technique. The flame leaves marks from leaves and other organic plant materials, salts, and copper wire.

In the saggar technique, the flame leaves indelible marks on the ceramic, which come from the materials in direct contact with the surface. For this vase, an iron wash, copper wire, sawdust, leaves, salts, and other plant materials were used. Before firing, the surface is treated with terra sigillata enriched with iron oxide to give it an intense reddish-brown color. The surface has a partially polished, aged texture, achieved through burnishing with a natural stone.

This is an artistic design and decor piece, entirely handmade on the potter's wheel. This ceramic is unglazed, as pottery was for millennia before the invention of glazes, and is wood-fired. The alchemy of these natural elements creates unique and unrepeatable chromatic and tactile effects.

Pit-fired ceramic vase in saggar, black lid, Japanese ispiration;"Handmade saggar pit-fired ceramic vase with black lid.

This unique vase was fired in a pit using the saggar technique, with natural materials such as leaves, copper wire, and other organic elements. During the wood firing, the flame reacts with these materials, leaving spontaneous and unrepeatable markings on the surface. The result is a dramatic, textured finish that tells the story of its creation.

Entirely handmade and wheel-thrown, the vase is crafted from unglazed clay and burnished by hand using a smooth natural stone, giving it a subtle sheen. The lid was blackened by wood smoke and finished with black acrylic paint.

Finally, the surface was polished with eco-friendly wax. This piece is a refined example of contemporary artisan ceramics with Japanese inspiration and Wabi Sabi philosophy.
