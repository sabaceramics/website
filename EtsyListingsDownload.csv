"Antiqued Raku vase with blue-purple reflections inside and cold smoke markings outside","Small stoneware vase shaped on the potter's wheel and finished through two separate decoration stages. The first phase involved a Raku reduction firing to develop blue and purple reflections on the interior.

Iron oxide spots and traces of burnt organic matter were captured directly on the clay, recording the unpredictable nature of the fire.
This double firing technique created a unique dialogue between the glazed surfaces and the raw, smoky texture of the outside.

"White raku ceramic candle holder tray, craquelé effect, black moon, warm home atmosphere","Raku Stoneware Candle Holder – Starry Sky and Moon
This candle holder represents a starry sky: the candlelight shines through the stars, creating a warm and cozy glow in your room. At the top, a small crescent moon is depicted.

The dome-shaped candle holder is integrated with a tray, made as a single piece: the dome and tray are not separate elements. The piece was wheel-thrown, while the holes and the moon were entirely handcrafted.

The white glaze is handmade, producing a striking black craquelé effect typical of raku. Being American raku, the piece was removed from the kiln while still glowing hot and placed in a closed container with combustible materials. This allows smoke to penetrate the unglazed areas, giving the moon and the glaze cracks their unique black color.

As visible in the photos, the tray features a small white trapezoid. This is a fragment of a pyrometric cone, an object used to measure heat work in ceramic kilns, which fused with the piece during firing. Rather than a flaw, it is a trace of how unexpected elements can become distinctive features in handmade ceramics, especially in the raku technique, enhancing the material and artisanal character.

"Decorative white horsehair raku vase, black feather marks, gold kintsugi, inspired by traditional Japanese chawans","Decorative white stoneware vase, ideal as a tabletop accent. Inspired by the shape of chawan, the traditional Japanese tea ceremony cups.

The vase was treated with white terra sigillata and polished, then decorated using the horsehair raku technique, which left black smoke marks from feathers on the hot surface.

The remarkable, unrepeatable patterns and colors are the result of a saggar firing within a bonfire pit. The vibrant palette of reds, ochres, and blacks is created by materials packed around the pot:

Copper wire left dark brown or black streaks, sometimes with greenish spots in the center, as in this pot.

Diverse plant leaves on the unglazed clay created haunting smoky gray and black carbon deposits and unique textures.

Salt was used to create unique effects on one side of the vessel, leaving behind striking gray spots and soft, pastel pink halos.

"Pit fired saggar vase with sculpted fox head and black moon lid","Vase with Fox Figure and Crescent Moon Lid, Wood-Fired in a Pit

In the saggar technique, the flame leaves permanent marks on the ceramic surface, created by the materials placed in direct contact with it. For this piece, a combination of iron wash, copper wire, sawdust, leaves, salts, and other plant-based materials was used. These natural traces are further enhanced by the polishing of the clay, done before firing through a traditional burnishing process—repeatedly rubbing the surface with a smooth stone.
The vase features a sculpted fox head, a symbol of nature and grace.

The lid represents a crescent moon, a symbol of renewal and energy. The black color comes from wood smoke and black acrylic paint.
Entirely handcrafted and wheel-thrown, this piece is also carefully sculpted. It is made of unglazed ceramic, just like pottery was for thousands of years before the invention of glaze, and has been pit-fired with wood, resulting in unique and unrepeatable chromatic and tactile effects.

The exterior has been polished with eco-friendly protective wax.

"Saggar fired vase in antique pink with black moon lid and spontaneous fire marks","Lidded vase fired in saggar using organic materials such as sugar, plant leaves, sawdust, salts, and copper wire. During the wood firing, the flame creates permanent and unpredictable marks on the ceramic surface. The clay was polished before firing by repeatedly rubbing it with a smooth natural stone. The pale pink color results from iron.

This piece is entirely handcrafted. The lid is decorated with a crescent moon, blackened by wood smoke and finished with black acrylic paint.

Traces of the materials used during firing remain visible on the surface, enhancing the vase’s uniqueness. This unglazed ceramic was wood-fired in a pit, producing one-of-a-kind effects that cannot be replicated.

Finally, the exterior has been polished with eco-friendly wax.

"Red saggar fired ceramic vase with natural leaf and copper wire markings","Interior vase for dried flowers, wood-fired using the saggar technique. The flame leaves marks from leaves and other organic plant materials, salts, and copper wire.

In the saggar technique, the flame leaves indelible marks on the ceramic, which come from the materials in direct contact with the surface. For this vase, an iron wash, copper wire, sawdust, leaves, salts, and other plant materials were used. Before firing, the surface is treated with terra sigillata enriched with iron oxide to give it an intense reddish-brown color. The surface has a partially polished, aged texture, achieved through burnishing with a natural stone.

This is an artistic design and decor piece, entirely handmade on the potter's wheel. This ceramic is unglazed, as pottery was for millennia before the invention of glazes, and is wood-fired. The alchemy of these natural elements creates unique and unrepeatable chromatic and tactile effects. The exterior surface was treated with a protective mineral wax.",109,EUR,1,"Saggar_vase,Raku,Organic_texture,Wood-fired_ceranic,Interior_design,Handmade,Wheel-thrown,Aged_ceramics,Unglazed_ceramics,Spontaneous_ceramic,Pit-fired_ceramic,dried_flowers,Handcrafted_ceramic",Ceramica,https://i.etsystatic.com/57670088/r/il/999b12/7524152234/il_fullxfull.7524152234_7dkl.jpg,https://i.etsystatic.com/57670088/r/il/d3f088/7221117462/il_fullxfull.7221117462_97h2.jpg,https://i.etsystatic.com/57670088/r/il/867927/7269088905/il_fullxfull.7269088905_3qn5.jpg,https://i.etsystatic.com/57670088/r/il/5e9475/7269088941/il_fullxfull.7269088941_lydh.jpg,https://i.etsystatic.com/57670088/r/il/fe0511/7221117540/il_fullxfull.7221117540_lbke.jpg,https://i.etsystatic.com/57670088/r/il/244366/7269088949/il_fullxfull.7269088949_j8qn.jpg,https://i.etsystatic.com/57670088/r/il/2f8e85/7221117548/il_fullxfull.7221117548_n5do.jpg,https://i.etsystatic.com/57670088/r/il/177c1c/7269088991/il_fullxfull.7269088991_1q37.jpg,https://i.etsystatic.com/57670088/r/il/ccd84b/7221117596/il_fullxfull.7221117596_chhe.jpg,,,,,,,,11
"Japanese inspired pit fired stoneware vessel with black lid and saggar markings","Handmade saggar pit-fired ceramic vase with black lid.

This unique vase was fired in a pit using the saggar technique, with natural materials such as leaves, copper wire, and other organic elements. During the wood firing, the flame reacts with these materials, leaving spontaneous and unrepeatable markings on the surface. The result is a dramatic, textured finish that tells the story of its creation.

Entirely handmade and wheel-thrown, the vase is crafted from unglazed clay and burnished by hand using a smooth natural stone, giving it a subtle sheen. The lid was blackened by wood smoke and finished with black acrylic paint.

Finally, the surface was polished with eco-friendly wax. This piece is a refined example of contemporary artisan ceramics with Japanese inspiration and Wabi Sabi philosophy.
